    Since I started learning machine learning (especially deep learning), I have collected a lot of online courses and their after-school exercises, pdfs for classic books, practical code for some practical projects, and so on.
    They gave me a lot of help on my self-study road. I hope to share with you, we will urge each other and make progress.
    Since many learning materials are collected at different times, some materials do not indicate the source.
